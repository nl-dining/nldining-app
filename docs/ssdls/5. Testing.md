# 🧪 5. Testing

This phase focuses on verifying that the NL Dining app is stable, functions as expected, and meets basic security requirements before release.

---

## ✅ Testing Objectives

- Ensure the app performs core tasks correctly (login, location, rating, booking)
- Validate that all user input is handled securely
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed (logs, storage, network)
- Prepare for manual review and final delivery

## 🛠️ Test Execution Plan

- Basic manual testing: Emulator + physical device
- At least one pass of security checklist before final week
- Optional: Set up GitHub Actions to run `./gradlew lint test` on push

## 📌 Notes

- Testing focuses on privacy, not production-scale security
- No external pentest or dynamic scans will be performed
- This phase overlaps with Release week for final verification
