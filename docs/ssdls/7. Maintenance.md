# üõ†Ô∏è 7. Maintenance

Maintenance is **not required** as part of this school project or examination. The app is considered complete upon final delivery and testing.

However, in a real-world scenario, maintenance would include:

- Fixing bugs reported by users
- Updating dependencies to fix vulnerabilities
- Rotating API keys or secrets regularly
- Adapting to changes in external APIs (e.g., Google Maps)

Since this project is a learning-focused prototype, no long-term support or updates will be provided after submission.
