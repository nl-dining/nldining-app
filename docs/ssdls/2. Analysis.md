## ⚙️ CI/CD and Security Considerations

### 🎯 Goals

- Automate testing, linting, and build steps
- Catch insecure code or secrets before pushing
- Keep the release pipeline simple but verifiable

### 🧰 Planned Stack

| Area             | Tool or Practice                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Version Control  | GitHub                           |
| CI/CD Workflow   | GitHub Actions (basic)           |
| Static Analysis  | [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) or Android Lint |
| Secrets Detection| [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) or manual review |
| Testing          | JUnit, Espresso                  |
| Build Signing    | Manual or test signing key only  |

### 🔐 Security Focus in CI/CD

- [ ] Ensure no hardcoded secrets make it into commits
- [ ] Use GitHub secrets if needed
- [ ] Check for known vulnerable dependencies (via `gradle dependencies`)
- [ ] Run lint/static scans on every push
- [ ] Restrict deploys to only reviewed code (even in student project)
