## 🎯 Project Overview

NL Dining is a Kotlin-based Android app that allows users to discover, rate, and simulate bookings for restaurants in the Netherlands using public/open APIs and secure user login.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deliver a functioning prototype
- Practice secure development life cycle
- Use only free APIs and open data
- Allow login, browsing, rating, and history

## 🔐 Initial Security Considerations

| Area         | Note                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Authentication | Required from MVP stage                 |
| Secure APIs  | All APIs must use HTTPS                   |
| Data Privacy | User history must not be publicly exposed |
| Rate Limits  | Protect against abuse and scraping        |

## 📅 Timeline (5 Weeks)
